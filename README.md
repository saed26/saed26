# Hi, I am Said 👋

## 👨‍💻 Who am I
I'm a Computer Engineering student based in Germany, interested in embedded systems, software engineering, and building practical products.  
I like turning ideas into working prototypes—especially where hardware + software meet.

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- 📚 University projects + exam prep (systems, electronics, software engineering)
- 🧠 Embedded + signal processing projects (e.g., MCU + sensors, audio / KWS-style pipelines)
- 🛠️ Personal projects: small apps/tools that solve real problems (automation, productivity, simple web services)

## 🧰 Tools I use
**Languages:** C/C++, Python, Java, (learning more as needed)  
**Embedded / HW:** STM32, Arduino, CubeIDE, HAL, I2C/SPI, DMA, timers  
**Dev Tools:** Git/GitHub, VS Code, Linux, Docker (basics)  
**Other:** LaTeX, UML/PlantUML, MATLAB/Octave (when required)
